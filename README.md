Comparative Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

The project is a comparative analysis to study the functionality of PCA, Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Laplacian Eigenmaps in reducing the dimensions of data, ready for the machine learning training and test process.

* The Project parameters *"KNN Neighbors"* and *"Eps Neighbors"* should be tested and modified for each method to achieve the best results.
